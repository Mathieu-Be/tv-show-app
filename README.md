## Tv Show App

# Description
<p>Tv Show app is a small and simple website I developed during my training, it allows to view information on a series list, add series in favorites...</p>

# Post-scriptum
<p>This site allows to connect in a non-secure way (clear passwords / storage in json format...).</p>
<p>The creation of this site dating from the beginning of my training, this one is coded in an imperative way without POO and without database (storage in json or in the form of php table).</p>
<p>The objective here was to put in place on a "balance sheet" project all the knowledge acquired previously (use of tables in php, GET and POST variables, SESSIONS variables, json format...) and not to make a totally completed and secure site (far from it...).</p>
